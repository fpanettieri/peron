# Preface

## Objective
Welcome to the Trade Engine Architecture. This book aims to present a complete guide on how to write a full trading engine in plain C.

## Intended audience
This book is intended for programmers who are interested in the FinTech industry and would like to write their own trading engines or interact with existing ones. Cryptocurrencies had sparked a generation with newly found curiosity for the financial system, and will be responsible for it's reinvention

We expect the reader to have a decent programming background, and to be able to debug a problem on their own.

# Why C
At some point in the 2010s we stopped caring about performance. The increasing computing power made us lazy. So programmers kept using higher level languages with thousands of dependencies. Suddenly our machines began to suck.
The most basic app requires 500M+ to run, which makes sense if you need to launch a full browser just to show a simple login screen.

This is an amazing opportunity for people that know how to code. We have now way more computing power than we need, and we understand how to use it.
