. your balance is used as collateral, you never move those coins
. PnL are directly related to position size, not collateral
. margin is used to reduce the amount of collateral used
. fees get multiplied by the leverage used
. volatility also gets amplified by leverage
. LEVERAGE IS BAD!!! you only get paid fees on the margin allocated. but pay fees in leveraged position
